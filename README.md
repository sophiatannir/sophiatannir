Hey there!

My name is Sophia and I'm a graduate student at Vanderbilt University. I'm a data scientist interested in sports analytics, media, and the politics of data.

For some examples of my package development, check out [nwslR](https://github.com/adror1/nwslR), a package I developed alongside [Arielle Dror](https://github.com/adror1) for working with women's soccer data in R.
